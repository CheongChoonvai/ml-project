## Problem Statement
Cambodia's healthcare system faces unique challenges that significantly impact care delivery:

1. **Digital Divide in Healthcare**: Predominantly paper-based systems cause inefficiencies, data silos, and limited analytics capabilities across Cambodian hospitals.

2. **Resource Constraints**: Severe limitations in healthcare staff, medical equipment, and facilities, particularly in rural areas, creating inequitable access to care.

3. **Manual Administrative Processes**: Time-consuming paperwork and error-prone record-keeping reducing staff productivity and introducing potential patient safety issues.

4. **Urban-Rural Healthcare Disparity**: Concentration of healthcare resources in urban centers (particularly Phnom Penh) with limited access in rural provinces where the majority of the population resides.

5. **Language and Literacy Barriers**: Need for systems that can accommodate varying levels of digital literacy and support both Khmer and English interfaces.

6. **Interrupted Care Continuity**: Lack of centralized patient records leading to fragmented care and repeated diagnostic testing when patients visit different facilities.

## Research Questions (What, Why and How)

```python
# Example hyperparameters for resource allocation optimization
lgbm_params = {
    'max_depth': 6,                  # Limited depth for faster inference
    'learning_rate': 0.05,           # Balanced for learning speed and stability
    'n_estimators': 200,             # Optimized for limited computing resources
    'subsample': 0.8,                # Provides robustness to noisy data
    'colsample_bytree': 0.75,        # Feature sampling for better generalization
    'min_child_weight': 3,           # Prevents overfitting on limited data
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'device': 'cpu',                 # Optimized for CPU-only environments
    'verbose': -1
}
```

Hyperparameter optimization will prioritize models that can run efficiently on the available hardware in Cambodian hospitals while maintaining acceptable performance.
